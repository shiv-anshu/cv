    <em>I am a student at Chandigarh University. Currently, I am learning C++ along with DSA. It will help me to grab good placement. Along with C++, I am learning full stack web devlopment, DBMS and OS. My dream is to become an entrepreneur. But I am preparing for placements because I want to prove myself that I can do anything that even I don't wanted to. 
    My Goal is to get an internship at Microsoft, Google or Uber. I am trying my best to crack these companies. After next year, I will be working as a software engineer intern. Afterwards, my goal is to crack CAT or GMAT exam to understand my studies further. I want to see the business world from very close side.
That's why I want to do my MBA.</em>

<h2>What I have Learnt in my life.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First thing, I have learnt in my life is that Everyone should try to be independent.</li>

    <li>We should always try to learn new things along with time instead of giving you mind the stable state.</li>

    <li>
        We should atleast try a thing for 6 months before leaving it or saying that it doesn't seems that much intersting.
    </li>
